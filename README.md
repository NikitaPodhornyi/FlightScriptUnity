# FlightScriptUnity
This is my physics based flight script i made for unity
It uses real physics formula of lift, some parts of this are not exact, just because the numbers end up too high, and game is not playable. 
This was part of my project i was hoping to develop into a full game, but unfortunately i didnt have the time to do so.
Also this has been a derivative of my first ever project. I was making "Flight Sim" for one of my courses in University, and i had a basic flight script there
that worked, but was not stanble enough. So as part of continuing developing it, i made a new script just to make it better.

I know this is not the most accurate or percise flight sim, and over time i know i can do better than that. But at a time i made it, i was prowd of this small project of mine. 

For some of the varibales, i had to use graphs to evaluate the current ratio based on given parameters.
